## [11.1.0] 2025-08-14

### Added

* **S3 Blob Storage Support**: Added comprehensive support for storing large fields in S3 instead of DynamoDB, enabling
  efficient storage of large data while maintaining fast query performance.
    - New `BlobFieldConfig` type for configuring blob field behavior (compression, content type, size limits)
    - Extended `ResourceConfig` with `blob_fields` configuration option
    - Created `S3BlobStorage` module for handling all S3 operations
    - Lazy loading of blob fields with `load_blobs` parameter and `load_blob_fields()` method
    - Full support for both versioned and non-versioned resources
    - Automatic compression with configurable gzip option
    - Size limit enforcement per field
    - Automatic cleanup of S3 blobs when resources are deleted
    - Complete backward compatibility - existing code works without changes

  Example usage:
  ```python
  class MyResource(DynamoDbResource):
      title: str
      large_data: Optional[dict] = None  # Stored in S3
      
      resource_config = ResourceConfig(
          blob_fields={
              "large_data": BlobFieldConfig(
                  compress=True,
                  content_type="application/json",
                  max_size_bytes=10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB limit
              )
          }
      )
  
  # Initialize with S3
  memory = DynamoDbMemory(
      logger=logger,
      table_name="my-table",
      s3_bucket="my-bucket",
      s3_key_prefix="blobs"  # optional
  )
  
  # Create - large_data automatically goes to S3
  resource = memory.create_new(MyResource, {
      "title": "Test",
      "large_data": {"huge": "dataset"}
  })
  
  # Read without blobs (fast)
  doc = memory.get_existing(id, MyResource)
  
  # Load blobs when needed
  doc.load_blob_fields(memory)
  ```

## [11.0.1] 2025-08-08

### Fixed

* **GSI Callable Handling**: Fixed issue where GSI callable functions returning `None` would incorrectly add fields with
  `None` values to DynamoDB items, causing validation errors. Now, when a GSI callable returns `None`, the corresponding
  field is properly excluded from the DynamoDB item.

## [11.0.0] 2025-08-08

### Changed

* **BREAKING: GSI Configuration**: Major refactoring of the GSI configuration system.
    - **GSI Configuration Breaking Change**: The GSI configuration format has changed from nested dictionaries with
      `"pk"` and `"sk"` keys to a flat dictionary structure where keys are the actual DynamoDB attribute names:
      ```python
      # Old format (still works via legacy methods)
      gsi_config = {
          "gsi1": {"pk": lambda self: f"owner#{self.owner}", "sk": lambda self: self.created_at.isoformat()}
      }
      
      # New format (required for classvar/classmethod approach)
      gsi_config = {
          "gsi1": {
              "gsi1pk": lambda self: f"owner#{self.owner}",
              "gsi1sk": lambda self: self.created_at.isoformat()
          }
      }
      ```
    - Simplified dynamic GSI field iteration to support arbitrary key names and both callables and static values
    - Updated GSI field exclusion logic in `from_dynamodb_item()` to dynamically handle any configured GSI fields

  **Note**: This is a breaking change for the GSI configuration feature introduced in v8.0.0 and v10.1.0, but since this
  feature
  was very recently added and has limited adoption, the impact should be minimal.

## [10.1.0] - 2025-08-08

### Added

* **GSI Configuration via Classmethod Override**: Added ability to override GSI configuration using a classmethod
  `get_gsi_config()` in addition to the existing classvar approach. This provides more flexibility for dynamic
  GSI configuration scenarios:
  ```python
  class MyResource(DynamoDbResource):
      @classmethod
      def get_gsi_config(cls) -> dict:
          # Dynamic GSI configuration logic here
          return {
              "gsi1": {"pk": lambda self: f"owner#{self.owner}", "sk": None},
          }
  ```
    - The classmethod takes precedence over the classvar when both are defined
    - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing classvar and legacy method approaches
    - Useful for cases where GSI configuration needs to be computed dynamically or based on environment

## [10.0.0] - 2025-08-08

### Changed

* **Refactored Version Limit Configuration**: Moved `max_versions` configuration from `model_config` to
  `resource_config`
  for better separation of concerns and consistency with other resource-level settings. This change:
    - Aligns version limiting with other resource configuration options like `compress_data`
    - Provides a cleaner API by separating Pydantic model configuration from resource-specific settings
    - Maintains backward compatibility through automatic config merging in subclasses

## [9.1.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

* **Versioned Repository with Version Management API**: New `VersionedResourceRepository` class in
  `simplesingletable.extras.versioned_repository` extends the repository pattern to provide comprehensive version
  management capabilities for `DynamoDbVersionedResource` models.

## [9.0.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added

* **Explicit Field Clearing in Updates**: Added `clear_fields` parameter to update methods, enabling explicit clearing
  of optional fields to `None`. This solves the common REST API design problem where there's no way to distinguish
  between "don't change this field" vs "clear this field to null":
  ```python
  # Clear an optional field to None
  updated = repo.update(
      existing_resource,
      {"name": "New Name"},
      clear_fields={"expires_at", "description"}
  )
  ```
    - Supported in both `DynamoDbMemory.update_existing()` and `ResourceRepository.update()`
    - Works with both versioned and non-versioned resources
    - Maintains backward compatibility - existing code continues to work unchanged

### Fixed

* **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Version Limit Enforcement Bug with Double-Digit Versions**: Fixed a critical bug in the
  `max_versions` functionality for `DynamoDbVersionedResource` where version numbers â‰¥10 were incorrectly
  deleted due to lexicographical sorting of version strings. Previously, when versions exceeded 9:
    - Version "v10" would sort before "v2" lexicographically
    - This caused the wrong versions to be deleted when enforcing `max_versions` limits
    - Resources would fail to update once reaching version 10

  **Impact**: This bug affected any versioned resources with `max_versions` configured that reached 10+ versions.
  The fix changes the sorting logic in `enforce_version_limit()` to sort by actual version numbers instead of
  version string keys, ensuring the most recent versions are always preserved correctly.

  **Migration**: No migration required - the fix is backward compatible and automatically resolves the issue.

## [8.2.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added

* **Repository Pattern Interface**: New `ResourceRepository` class in `simplesingletable.extras.repository` provides a
  simplified CRUD interface on top of `DynamoDbMemory`. Features include:
    - Type-safe operations with Pydantic schema validation for create/update operations
    - Support for both versioned and non-versioned resources
    - Flexible ID generation with optional override functions
    - Default object creation with customizable factory functions
    - Traditional repository methods: `create()`, `get()`, `read()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `list()`, `get_or_create()`
    - Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## [8.1.1] - 2025-07-15

### Added

* **Versioned Resource Deletion**: Added support for deleting versioned resources with new `delete_existing()` method
  that handles both specific version deletion and automatic v0 cleanup, plus `delete_all_versions()` method for bulk
  deletion.

## [8.0.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added

* **Dynamic GSI Configuration**: Introduced declarative index configuration system using `gsi_config` class variable on
  resource models. This replaces hardcoded GSI logic and makes it easy to define custom indices:
  ```python
  gsi_config = {
      'gsi1': {
          'pk': lambda self: f"category#{self.category}",
          'sk': lambda self: self.created_at.isoformat(),
      }
  }
  ```
* **Version Limit Enforcement**: Added `max_versions` configuration for `DynamoDbVersionedResource` to automatically
  clean up old versions:
  ```python
  model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", max_versions=5)
  ```
* **Improved Transaction Error Handling**: New `transact_write_safe()` function provides detailed error messages when
  DynamoDB transactions fail, making debugging much easier.
* **Dynamic Pagination Helper**: Added `build_lek_data()` function that dynamically constructs LastEvaluatedKey based on
  index configuration, eliminating 30+ lines of hardcoded logic.

### Changed

* Refactored `paginated_dynamodb_query` to use the new dynamic pagination helper, removing hardcoded index handling.
* Updated `to_dynamodb_item()` methods to support both new dynamic GSI configuration and legacy GSI methods for backward
  compatibility.
* All DynamoDB transactions now use the safer error handling wrapper.

### Fixed

* GSI field exclusion in `from_dynamodb_item()` now dynamically handles configured indices instead of using a hardcoded
  list.

## [7.0.0]

### Changed

* Enhanced `paginated_dynamodb_query` and `list_type_by_updated_at` to properly support boto3's ConditionBase for filter
  expressions. This allows using `Attr` conditions (e.g., `Attr('status').eq('active')`) which automatically handle
  expression attribute names and values, making filtering safer and more convenient.
